# Heart Disease Early Detection ML Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline for the early detection of heart diseases using Apache Spark, MLlib library, and a variety of machine learning algorithms including RandomForest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. The pipeline is designed to process a CSV database, apply transformations, train models, evaluate their performance, and showcase results through data visualization.

## Project Highlights
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  - RandomForest
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost

- **Processing Chain:**
  - **Transformers:** Utilized 2  transformers in the processing chain.
  - **Estimator:** Trained models using various algorithms.
  - **Pipeline:** Structured a pipeline for seamless data processing.
  - **Evaluation:** Determined key metrics to assess model performance.

- **Activity:**
  - Hunted down a suitable CSV database for the project. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
  - Illustrated the processing chain with a focus on transformers, estimators, pipelines, and evaluation.
  - Programmed a notebook, rigorously tested, and ensured functionality.
  - Showcased results through effective data visualization.

## Results
- Witness the power of data-driven insights!
- The pipeline demonstrated promising outcomes in the early detection of heart diseases.
- Achieved accuracy and efficiency through strategic algorithmic choices.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.11.5)
